# linked_lists
My First Data Structure 

In this project I am going to be creating linked lists! I will have a linked list factory and a node factory. I will then build a bunch of different function that interacts with the data structure like a append, prepend, size, etc. The goal of this project/practice is to become familiar with linked lists, the most basic of data structures so it will be easier to progress into harder data structures. 

All done with this one! Personally, I thought this was a bit easy, lots of copy pasting as some of the functions were very similar. Getting started is always the hardest part... I'm still a bit confused with factory/class syntax and I'm reeeeally dragging my feet on getting better at them.
