# linked_lists
My First Data Structure 

In this project I am going to be creating linked lists! I will have a linked list factory and a node factory. I will then build a bunch of different function that interacts with the data structure like a append, prepend, size, etc. The goal of this project/practice is to become familiar with linked lists, the most basic of data structures so it will be easier to progress into harder data structures.
